/*
In JavaScript, a variable is used to hold a value.
To use a variable, you must first declare it.
Variables can be assigned a value.
When you do this while you declare it, this is called initialization.
When a variable name has multiple words, the convention in JavaScript is to use what's called camelCase.
The first word is lowercase, and the first letter of every following word is uppercase.
The variables you have assigned have all had values that are numbers.
JavaScript has multiple different data types.
The next one you will use is the string. Strings are used to store things like words or text.
Strings are surrounded with double quotes, single quotes, or backticks.
The player's inventory in your game will be able to hold multiple items.
You will need to use a data type that can do this.
An array can be used to hold multiple values.
For example:
let order = ["first", "second", "third"];
This is an array which holds three values.
Notice how the values are separated by commas.
