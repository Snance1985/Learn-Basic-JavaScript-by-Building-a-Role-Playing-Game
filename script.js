/*
In JavaScript, a variable is used to hold a value.
To use a variable, you must first declare it.
Variables can be assigned a value.
When you do this while you declare it, this is called initialization.
When a variable name has multiple words, the convention in JavaScript is to use what's called camelCase.
The first word is lowercase, and the first letter of every following word is uppercase.
